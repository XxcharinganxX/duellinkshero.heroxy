<br>
<h2 style=color:FloralWhite > Overview:
<p>
The Sylvans archetype emerged from the Rampage of the Forest Mini Box and is currently the cheapest to build in comparison to the other two Tier 1 decks: Geargias and Masked Heroes. Each Sylvan Monster has itâ€™s own unique Field effect that allows it to excavate card(s) from the Deck and also Graveyard effects that range from destroying Monsters, backrow, boosting ATK/DEF and many more! The ideal play is to excavate multiple Sylvan Komushroomo and/or Sylvan Marshalleaf to destroy your opponents entire field and swing for a easy OTK!

<p>
A great combo is to get World Carrotweight Champion into the Graveyard, then use its effect to discard a Monster (preferably Rose Lover) to Special Summon itself, then using the effect of Rose Lover to Special Summon one of your boss monsters: either Sylvan Hermitree or Sylvan Guardioak. This usually allows you to excavate other Sylvans from the Deck, setting up game the current or following turn.
