<br>
<h2 style=color:FloralWhite > Overview:
<p>
Red-Eyes Zombies is a top tier deck because it is one of the most versatile decks in the game since the day it came out. Red-Eyes Zombies can keep it’s core cards and tech-in certain cards to adapt to the meta as it evolves. The decks main engine revolves around Gozuki, the most important card of the deck next to Red-Eyes Zombie Dragon. 
<p>
The deck can be played two ways: as an agressive OTK (One Turn Kill) deck or a semi-agressive control deck depending on the tech cards you run. For example, a Red-Eyes Zombies deck that has only anti-backrow, 3 Enemy Controllers and it’s core cards is built for an OTK. The Red-Eyes Zombies decks that run Wall of Disruption, Mirror Walls, Snipe Hunter and other techs play more like a control deck. Both versions of this deck dominate in competitive tournaments as well as the Duel Links Ranked ladder.
<p>
The biggest drawback of this deck is it’s ability to start you off with completely unplayable hands. This doesn’t happen often but happens enough to make Red-Eyes Zombies players pull the hair out of their heads.
